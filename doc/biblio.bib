    abstract="It is widely recognized that white spaces identifica- tion is an important milestone for the wide deployment of next generation cognitive wireless networks. However, spectrum holes detection tools used for white spaces discovery are still either in the infancy stage or too expensive to enable massive white spaces exploitation. Building upon cheap hardware equipment, this paper presents experiments conducted in the town of Trieste in Italy to sense the environment and find out which frequencies are not being used in a particular place and time-of-the-day. As a a step towards white spaces exploitation, we believe that our experimental frequency exploration is an important milestone upon which white spaces patterns recognition will be built with the aim of using these patterns in wireless network planning and management."

abstract={The paper proposes a distributed architecture to monitor spectrum occupancy status through the use of Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Such a monitoring process is useful in order to fulfill a geolocation database, whose consultation is a mandatory task for license-exempt devices operating under the IEEE 802.22 standard rules. Moreover, the system is thought for a dual use scenarios: it can be enforced with higher security levels and different sensing approaches when an emergency situation occurs and a military control of the architecture has to be taken; conversely, it can be used by civil authorities for new generation networks, in normal conditions. The system has been tested in laboratory conditions with real SDR devices and Ethernet connection to the central node. First performance results in terms of sensing capabilities are shown in the paper.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a technique for scanning and evaluating the radio spectrum use. This technique determines the average occupancy of a channel over a specific duration. The technique was implemented using Software Defined Radio units and GNU Radio software. The survey was conducted in Grand Forks, North Dakota, over a frequency range of 824 MHz to 5.8 GHz. The results of this technique were compared to those of two existing techniques, energy detection and autocorrelation, that were also implemented. The results show that the proposed technique is more efficient at scanning the radio spectrum than the other two techniques.}

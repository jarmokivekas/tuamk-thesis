abstract={It is widely recognized that white spaces identification is an important milestone for the wide deployment of next generation cognitive wireless networks. However, spectrum holes detection tools used for white spaces discovery are still either in the infancy stage or too expensive to enable massive white spaces exploitation. Building upon cheap hardware equipment, this paper presents experiments conducted in the town of Trieste in Italy to sense the environment and find out which frequencies are not being used in a particular place and time-of-the-day. As a a step towards white spaces exploitation, we believe that our experimental frequency exploration is an important milestone upon which white spaces patterns recognition will be built with the aim of using these patterns in wireless network planning and management.},

abstract={Recently a lot of attention has been given to the use of TV White Spaces for rural communications. Several monitoring campaigns have been carried out to measure spectrum occupancy worldwide, concluding that most of the spectrum is underutilized. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a low cost system to measure spectrum occupancy and to geo-tag the measurements to allow mobile measurement campaigns. The system is based on the Raspberry Pi system on chip and on an affordable spectrum analyser. After calibrating the system against a professional spectrum analyser, we measured the spectrum occupancy in urban and rural Venezuela, showing that there is plenty of vacant UHF TV spectrum.},

abstract={The paper proposes a distributed architecture to monitor spectrum occupancy status through the use of Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Such a monitoring process is useful in order to fulfill a geolocation database, whose consultation is a mandatory task for license-exempt devices operating under the IEEE 802.22 standard rules. Moreover, the system is thought for a dual use scenarios: it can be enforced with higher security levels and different sensing approaches when an emergency situation occurs and a military control of the architecture has to be taken; conversely, it can be used by civil authorities for new generation networks, in normal conditions. The system has been tested in laboratory conditions with real SDR devices and Ethernet connection to the central node. First performance results in terms of sensing capabilities are shown in the paper.},

abstract={This paper presents a technique for scanning and evaluating the radio spectrum use. This technique determines the average occupancy of a channel over a specific duration. The technique was implemented using Software Defined Radio units and GNU Radio software. The survey was conducted in Grand Forks, North Dakota, over a frequency range of 824 MHz to 5.8 GHz. The results of this technique were compared to those of two existing techniques, energy detection and autocorrelation, that were also implemented. The results show that the proposed technique is more efficient at scanning the radio spectrum than the other two techniques.},

year={2013},
pages={517-522},
abstract={Rapid growth on new technologies and services in mobile communication leads to stronger competition in spectrum access. As a developed country, Malaysia is also affected by this trend. With the increasing numbers of subscribers, the easier solution for mobile service providers to improve the coverage area is by installing new base station (BS). Nevertheless, this increases the possibilities of interference among BS. Thus, spectrum monitoring is needed to maintain the efficiency of the network and avoid interference. However, the commercial spectrum monitoring tool is not a cost effective enough in the fast pace changing mobile communication environment. Hence, the need for development of a low cost radio frequency (RF) spectrum monitoring tool to identified and monitor interference. This paper aims to highlight the approaches taken in developing an open-source spectrum management tool for Malaysian authority. The simple low cost tool is capable to identified possible interference among BS in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), 2G and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (IMT), 3G networks as well as capable to display BS cell coverage area.},

abstract={It is widely recognized that white spaces identification is an important milestone for the wide deployment of next generation cognitive wireless networks. However, spectrum holes detection tools used for white spaces discovery are still either in the infancy stage or too expensive to enable massive white spaces exploitation. Building upon cheap hardware equipment, this paper presents experiments conducted in the town of Trieste in Italy to sense the environment and find out which frequencies are not being used in a particular place and time-of-the-day. As a a step towards white spaces exploitation, we believe that our experimental frequency exploration is an important milestone upon which white spaces patterns recognition will be built with the aim of using these patterns in wireless network planning and management.},

The system is based on the Raspberry Pi system on chip and on an affordable spectrum analyser. After calibrating the system against a professional spectrum analyser, we measured the spectrum occupancy in urban and rural Venezuela, showing that there is plenty of vacant UHF TV spectrum.},

Moreover, the system is thought for a dual use scenarios: it can be enforced with higher security levels and different sensing approaches when an emergency situation occurs and a military control of the architecture has to be taken; conversely, it can be used by civil authorities for new generation networks, in normal conditions. The system has been tested in laboratory conditions with real SDR devices and Ethernet connection to the central node. First performance results in terms of sensing capabilities are shown in the paper.},

The technique was implemented using Software Defined Radio units and GNU Radio software. The survey was conducted in Grand Forks, North Dakota, over a frequency range of 824 MHz to 5.8 GHz. The results of this technique were compared to those of two existing techniques, energy detection and autocorrelation, that were also implemented. The results show that the proposed technique is more efficient at scanning the radio spectrum than the other two techniques.},

abstract={Rapid growth on new technologies and services in mobile communication leads to stronger competition in spectrum access. As a developed country, Malaysia is also affected by this trend. With the increasing numbers of subscribers, the easier solution for mobile service providers to improve the coverage area is by installing new base station (BS). Nevertheless, this increases the possibilities of interference among BS. Thus, spectrum monitoring is needed to maintain the efficiency of the network and avoid interference. However, the commercial spectrum monitoring tool is not a cost effective enough in the fast pace changing mobile communication environment. Hence, the need for development of a low cost radio frequency (RF) spectrum monitoring tool to identified and monitor interference. This paper aims to highlight the approaches taken in developing an open-source spectrum management tool for Malaysian authority. The simple low cost tool is capable to identified possible interference among BS in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), 2G and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (IMT), 3G networks as well as capable to display BS cell coverage area.},

abstract={In order to provide meaningful data about spectrum use, occupancy measurements describing the utilization rate of a specific frequency band should be conducted over a specific area instead of a single location. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for the measurement and analysis of spectrum occupancy. This paper surveys spectrum measurement campaigns and associated interference maps, introducing the latter as a tool for spectrum analysis and management based on measurement data. An interference map characterizes the spectrum use by defining the level of interference over an area of interest in a certain frequency band. Building on findings from practical measurement studies, guidelines for spectrum occupancy measurements are given. While many scientific spectrum occupancy measurement papers tend to be too optimistic about the significance and generality of the results, we propose a cautionary perspective on drawing strong conclusions based on the often limited amount of data gathered. The different phases of the spectrum occupancy measurement and analysis process are described and a thorough discussion of interpolation methods is provided. Means to improve the measurement accuracy are discussed, especially regarding spatial domain considerations and the impact of the sampling interval on the results. A practical example of an improved measurement system design covering all the phases of the measurement process and used at the Turku, Finland; Blacksburg, VA, USA; and Chicago, IL, USA, spectrum observatories is given. Using the improved design, more realistic spectrum occupancy data can be obtained to lay the foundation for spectrum management decisions.},

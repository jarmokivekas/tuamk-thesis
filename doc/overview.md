# Introduction


This thesis covers basic aspects of radio spectrum monitoring and some of its
applications in modern communication systems.

Spectrum monitoring, in  general sense, involves sensing and interpreting the frequency content
of a band of the     radio spectrum over time \cite{ni-white-15}.
The complexity of monitoring systems can vary from simple running time-averages
of a sensed spectrum to much more complex systems that can for example partially
decode signaling protocols, store spectrum usage history, and analyze data either in real-time or in post-processing in order to provide more information \cite{gronroos16}\cite{ni-white-15}.

The bulk of work in this thesis is the implementation of a radio spectrum monitoring system
consisting of a commercial software-defined radio peripheral and a Linux laptop with
custom application logic, post-processing, and data visualization scripts.

## Orthogonal Frequencies-Division Multiplexing

OFDM is used in most contemporary communication systems, including cellular standards such as WiMax and LTE Advanced, digital broadcasting such as DVB-T, and several IEEE 802.11 standards.\cite{bloessl13}

This section is based on \cite{lte-ofdm-ofdma-scfdma}
http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/cellulartelecomms/lte-long-term-evolution/lte-ofdm-ofdma-scfdma.php

Multiple closely spaced carriers are modulated with a low data rate. Using orthogonal modulations means there is no mutual interference between the closely spaced carriers.

OFDM can also be used with TDD and FDD (division duplex? **TODO**)

The band consists of:

- B18  (800 Lower)
- B19  (800 Upper)
- B20  (800 DD)

## Spectrum Allocation

Conventionally bands of the radio spectrum are allocated for use in a
particular application, and the rights to transmit on those bands
are licensed by a governing body. Licensees may obtain licenses for
comparatively long spans of time, during which the allocated spectrum
may not be used continuously and in full.
Faster data transmission rates and widespread use of radio-based communications\cite{subramaniam15}

The Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (FICORA) is the governing
body that handles spectrum allocation in Finland. FICORA regulates the
use of frequencies 9 kHz -- 400 GHz \cite{ficoraReg15}.

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a United Nations specialized agency that allocates
radio spectrum and satellite orbits. The ITU is involved in coordinating with national regulatory authorities
to maintain cross-compatible radio regulations globally.

Advances in radio technology allow the implementation of flexible
radio systems that reduce underutilization of available RF spectrum.
\cite{gronroos16}. Thanks to increased flexibility, transmission
frequencies, bandwidth, and modulation schemes can be changed rapidly
in a dynamic way in order to accommodate for changes in the available
spectrum.  Spectrum monitoring is a key technology when considering the
use of dynamic spectrum access \cite{zennaro12}.

## Applications of Spectrum Monitoring


### Opportunistic Spectrum access

A concrete example dynamic spectrum access is the secondary use of TV
whitespace (TVWS). In Finland

### Enforcement of Radio Regulation

## Licensed Shared Access

Licensed shared access (LSA) is an approach to radio spectrum regulation
that allows further use of spectrum that is already allocated to
an incumbent user.  LSA is based on a framework where the incumbent
user, one or several LSA licensees -- i.e new users, and the spectrum
regulation authority collectively agree on a sharing scheme. The sharing
scheme in LSA is controlled in a way that both the incumbent user, as
well as the licensee can expect predictable quality-of-service and are
protected from interference. \cite{lsa}

Availability information and spectrum access policies are held centrally
in an LSA repository. Spectrum monitoring is a key component for implementing
a system such as LSA.

## Spectrum Sensing Methods

<!-- TODO: this section -->
Sensing applications can be either generalized or designed for
a specific type of transmission, in order to monitor the use of particular
standardized channels of a radio system.

### Energy Detection

<!--  subramanima15 has many references to sensing studies --> <!-- "using
the energy detection method with fixed-threshold [9]" \cite{subramaniam15}
-->

Energy detection is commonly used in research applications to determine
the utilization of radio frequencies. In a
simplistic application, energy detection can be done by digitizing a span
of spectrum using a software defined radio, or a purpose-built spectrum
analyzer.  A binary decision about whether a particular frequency is in
use is made by comparing the received RF energy on that frequency to a
fixed threshold value. \cite {subramaniam15}

Energy detection using a fixed threshold is problematic.  Threshold values
that are set manually are error prone, and may need re-adjustment
depending on the environment in which measurements are done.
A threshold that is set too high will cause false negatives when
a signal that is present is not strong enough to pass the threshold.
Similarly, if the threshold value is too low, false positives may be
triggered by noise, whether man-made or otherwise, that exceeds the
threshold. \cite{subramaniam15}

## Software Defined Radio


A software defined radio peripheral is in simple terms a fast ADC that's
attached to an antenna. SDR platforms are used to digitize a section
of the radio spectrum which is then either processed in real-time, or it can be
written to non-volatile storage and processing of data can happen at a
later stage.

In an optimal SDR solution the antenna would be essentially connected
directly to the ADC. However, in actual applications, it is usually
necessary to implement a radio front end. Typical parts of such a
front end include a band select filter, a low-noise amplifier (LNA),
and a mixing stage. \cite{raman15}



# Materials and Methods

This section describes the implementation of a radio spectrum monitoring system using an NI USRP as the antenna
interface. The application logic of the spectrum monitor was implemented in the
Python \cite{python_software} scripting language by utilizing the open-source
GNU radio \cite{gnu_radio_software} software suite and adjacent code libraries for DSP algorithms,
visualization, and controlling the USRP.



## The Universal Software Radio Peripheral

The USRP is a platform that is designed for research applications
\cite{needed}, and it's evident based on earlier research publications
that is suitable for spectrum sensing applications \cite{angrisani16}.

The USRP has an FPGA that can be used for simple signal processing,
however, due to the relatively small size of the FPGA, it is limited in
its capability, and cannot be used to implement complex PHY layer DPS
blocks. \cite{ni-forum-question}


## Data flow

The USRP's center frequency is incremented at regular intervals to complete
full scans of a wide part of the spectrum.
An FFT is calculated and stored for each hop during the scan.

The difference in the center frequency of each consecutive hop is slightly less
than what the width of each FFT. This overlap between FFTs can be used to improve
data quality by discarding some of the lowest and highest frequency FFT bins,
which may suffer from roll-off.

## Data model

The scan data is represented as a tabular data structure where each row
represents a single FFT bin.

The columns in the data structure are

- date: a timestamp with millisecond accuracy
- center: the center frequency to which the USRP was tuned
- freq: frequency of the FFT bin
- mag: power magnitude of the FFT bin
- power: sensed
<!-- - noise: the power of the low*    *TODO** deprecate this bullet point** -->
<!-- these are scan and sweep in the actual source code -->
- hop: which incremental hop of a scan the FFT bin belongs to
- scan: which incremental scan the hop of the FFT bin belongs to

Representing the data in the described manner allows for easy manipulation
of the data with existing tools at the cost of increased data set size due
to redundancy.

Developing a more storage-efficient data model is outside the scope of work
for this thesis.

## Data storage on disk

The collected spectrum data can be stored long-term in plain text files as
comma separated tabular data in .csv files. This makes it easy to import the data into
a large variety of applications for post-processing.

Alternatively, the data can be stored in a more compact way using python's native
pickle storage. This is in order to collect data over long periods of time,


<!--  CAN IT, THOUGH? -->
<!-- The USRP is capable of streaming up to 50 MSPS over Gigabit Ethernet\cite{ettusN210}, which is a high enough sample rate that the entire LTE 800 DD band, which covers a 30 MHz span at 791 â 821 MHz \cite{ficoraAlloc15} can be captured by a single FFT. -->


## Choosing the sample rate.

What sample rate is chosen impacts the speed of scanning and the available frequency
resolution.

The USRP is able to stream complex samples over its Gigabit Ethernet interface
at rates of up to 50 MSPS at an 8-bit resolution and 25 MSPS at a 16-bit resolution.
The resolution of the 16-bit samples is 14-bit in practice, which is the maximum
accuracy of the ADCs used for sample acquisition. \cite{ettusN210}

An 8-bit sample refers to a sampling scheme where 8 bits are used to each of the
I and Q sample, making the I/Q sample pair a total of 16 bits is size. Similarly an
I/Q pair of 16-bit samples 32 bits in size.

The USRP and GNURadio ecosystems for signal processing primarily use I/Q-sampling
when representing waveforms digitally.
The Nyquist frequency for complex sampling is equal to the complex sample rate.
In this context, passband width is often shown as the same value as the signal sample rate.
In fact, passband width is often referred to simply as the sample rate. \cite{needed}



## CIC roll-off

Cascaded integrator-comb filters, CIC filters for short, are a class of hardware-efficient
finite response filters that can be used for decimation and interpolation of a signal \cite{donadio2000}

The USRP's integrated FPGA processes samples at 100 MSPS from the antenna ADC.
The samples are downsampled to a lower sample rate in order to transfer them
over the Gigabit Ethernet interface to the computer using a CIC filter.

The chosen sample rate has a significant impact on the quality of the scan data.
Choosing an inappropriate sample rate will cause the data to have CIC roll-off
artifacts from the filter that is involved in the down sampling.

The input sample rate to output sample rate ratio of the conversion needs to be even in
order to avoid CIC-roll-off. The CIC roll-off is at its worst when the ratio is odd.

$$\cfrac{R_{in}}{R_{out}} \mod 2 = 0$$


#### CIC roll-off measurements


The measurements shown in \ref{fig:cic-rollof} show the manifestation of CIC roll-off
at two distinct sample rates. The resampling is done from 100 MSPS, therefore
the rate rations are 100  MSPS / 20  MSPS} = 5 (odd) and
100 MSPS / 25 MSPS = 4 (even)

The sample rates 20 MSPS and 25 MSPS were chosen to show the most extreme and
least extreme cases of CIC roll-off while still maintaining the highest
available sample rate, in this case, using 16-bit samples. Choosing a high sample
rate allows for measuring a wider band of the spectrum at once, which is desirable
in the context of the spectrum monitoring application presented in this thesis.

The carriers visible in the center of plotted spectra in \ref{fig:cic-rolloff} are
DC offset artifacts caused by phenomenon unrelated to CIC roll-off.

The measurements verify what should be there, in theory, is observable in
practice.

# Discussion

## Protecting the radio peripheral

An inherent quality of radio spectrum monitoring applications is that receiver
equipment needs to be able to cope with very high-power transmissions in order
to have a robust system. When tuning the monitoring system to a certain
band, one can not be certain of what signals will be present at those frequencies.

In spectrum monitoring, it is often desirable to be able to record the presence of signals
regardless of their power. A general monitoring application may not have given standardized specifications
to conform to in the same manner as a traditional receiver purpose-built for a specific
communications application.
A purpose-built receiver doesn't necessarily need to work with signal strengths
that are too low or too high to conform with the expected signal strengths given
in the application's standard. Out-of-spec signals can be rejected and ignored.


Simplified measurement of the RF energy on present on a band can be done on an
attenuated version of the signal to set the receiver's gain to an
appropriate level and protect the monitoring system from damage caused by high-power signals.

This added level of protection may come at the expense of performance, as sensing
the power of a band and setting the receiver gain before tuning the radio peripheral
to the band in question will some amount time. This time can accumulate
if the system is used to scan a wide band of spectrum by constantly re-tuning the radio peripheral,
making each full scan take longer.

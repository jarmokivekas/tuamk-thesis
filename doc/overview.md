## Applications of Spectrum Monitoring

Spectrum monitoring is applications are key technology when considering the use of dynamic spectrum access. Advances in radio technology allows for implementing flexible radio systems that reduce underutilization of available RF spectrum. \cite{gronroos16} \cite{ni-forum-question}

## The Universal Sofware Defined Radio Peripheral

The USRP has a FPGA that can be used for simple signal processing, however due to the relatively small size of the FPGA, it is limited in it's capability, and cannot be used to implement complex PHY layer DPS blocks. \cite{ni-forum-question}

# Key concepts


Advances in radio technology allows the implementation of flexible radio systems that reduce underutilization of available RF spectrum \cite{gronroos16}.
Thanks to increased flexibility, transmission frequencies, bandwidth, and modulation schemes can be changed rapidly in a dynamic way in order to accommodate for changes in the available spectrum.
Spectrum monitoring is a key technology when considering the use of dynamic spectrum access \cite{zennaro12}.

Conventionally bands of radio spectrum are allocated for use in a particular application, and the rights to transmit on those bands is licensed by a governing body.

The Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (FICORA) regulates the use of frequencies 9 kHz -- 400 GHz \cite{ficoraReg15}. The 2

## Applications of Spectrum Monitoring

### Opportunistic Spectrum access

A concrete example dynamic spectrum access is the secondary use of TV whitespace (TVWS). In Finland

### Enforcement of Radio Regulation

## Software Defined Radio

### The Universal Sofware Defined Radio Peripheral

The USRP is a platform that is designed for research applications \cite{needed}, and it is evident based on earlier research publications that is suitable for spectrum sensing applications \cite{angrisani16}.

The USRP has an FPGA that can be used for simple signal processing, however due to the relatively small size of the FPGA, it is limited in it's capability, and cannot be used to implement complex PHY layer DPS blocks. \cite{ni-forum-question}

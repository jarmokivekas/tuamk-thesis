This thesis covers general theory about the applications radio spectrum occupancy
monitoring, and the methods behind it, and describes essential elements of a
spectrum monitoring system that was implemented as part of the work for this
thesis using a National Instruments Universal Radio Peripheral and custom
application logic. The intention of the work was not to implement a feature-rich
monitoring system but to instead to use the implementation process of a simpler
system as a way to create a solid base understanding of the various parts of such
a system by finding solutions to problems encountered on the way.
Measurements were done to observe the behavior phenomena such as CIC roll-off,
DC-offset, and the trade-off relations between system characteristics such as
frequency resolution, temporal resolution, required computational power,
and data set size.

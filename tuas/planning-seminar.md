# Methods & Tools

- Software defined radio
    - GNU Radio
    - USRP n201
- Signal processing
    - Baudline
    - python (numpy, scipy)
    - julia?
- Signal capture from the ICT antenna platform.



# Practicalities

- IEEExplore as the main information source
- BibTeX for tracking reference
- Work and data tracked with Git and Git LFS

# Schedule

- Started work late December 2016
- Large parts of background theory already written
- Test system implementation already started
- Topic not strictly specified yet
- Complete at end of April

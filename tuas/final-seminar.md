# Tools & Practicalities

- USRP (Ettus Research/National Instruments)
- GNU Radio
- python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter notebooks
    - plenty of detailed notes
    - annotate all the data
- Julia
- Baudline



# Tools & Practicalities

- Started work late December 2016
- Topic not strictly specified
    - Articles from IEEExplore
    - Annotate and save reference material
- Kept all personal deadlines
    - there weren't any other
- Writing and practical work complete


- BibTeX, Git, Rsync, Makefiles
- Lab notebooks
